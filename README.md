<h1>Emotion-recognition-through-voice</h1>
<h3>Description in a nutshell</h3>
<p>The main objective of the project is to detect emotion through voice by building a one
dimentional Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) model by taking into
consideration the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients(MFCC)-a feature
extracted from the audio signals which relates the perceived frequency of a
tone to the actual measured frequency.</p>
